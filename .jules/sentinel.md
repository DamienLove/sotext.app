## 2024-05-24 - Firestore Identity Spoofing Fix
**Vulnerability:** The `users_by_phone` collection allowed any authenticated user to create a mapping for *any* phone number to their own UID, enabling identity spoofing.
**Learning:** Firestore rules do not automatically link `request.auth.token` attributes to document paths. You must explicitly enforce that the path variable (e.g., `phoneNumber`) matches the auth token claim (`request.auth.token.phone_number`).
**Prevention:** Always verify that user-claimable identifiers in document paths match the immutable claims in the auth token.

## 2024-05-25 - Shared Cache Poisoning
**Vulnerability:** The `callerIdCache` collection allowed any authenticated user to write to any document, enabling a malicious user to poison the global shared caller ID cache with false information (e.g., marking a safe number as spam).
**Learning:** Client-side "crowdsourcing" of shared data (like global caches) is inherently insecure if implemented via direct database writes (`allow write: if request.auth != null`). Malicious clients can always bypass client-side logic.
**Prevention:** Shared/global data structures must be read-only for clients. Writes must be mediated by a trusted backend (Cloud Function) that validates the source and content, or the feature must be redesigned to be user-specific (personal cache).

## 2024-05-26 - Public Write Bypass (Themes)
**Vulnerability:** The `themes_public` collection allowed users to bypass the moderation queue by writing directly to the public collection with `status: "approved"` in the request data, as the rule relied on the user-provided data for validation.
**Learning:** Never trust client-provided data (e.g., `request.resource.data.status`) to enforce workflow states like "approved" or "verified". If a user can write the data, they can write any state they want.
**Prevention:** State transitions (like Pending -> Approved) for shared resources must be performed by a privileged backend environment (Admin SDK) that the user cannot directly manipulate, or the collection must be read-only for clients.

## 2024-05-27 - Frontend Secret Exposure
**Vulnerability:** The Spotify Client Secret was exposed in the frontend bundle via `import.meta.env.VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
**Learning:** `VITE_` (and `REACT_APP_`) environment variables are embedded into the built JavaScript files and are visible to anyone who inspects the client code. They are not secure for private keys or secrets.
**Prevention:** Never use `VITE_` or similar prefixes for secrets. Secrets must be stored in the backend (e.g., Firebase Functions secrets or config) and accessed only by server-side code. The frontend should call a Cloud Function to perform actions requiring the secret.
