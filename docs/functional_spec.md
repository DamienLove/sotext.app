# PulseLink Functional Spec

## Overview
PulseLink passively listens for user-defined trigger phrases ("PulseLink phrases") and escalates alerts to trusted contacts across SMS, high-priority notifications, and optional automated calls. The system must never block outgoing or incoming messaging; it augments communication pathways instead of restricting them.

## Core Capabilities
- Continuous phrase detection via foreground service + on-device speech recognition
- Alert orchestration that can:
  - Send SMS messages with high-visibility language
  - Dispatch critical notifications that override Do Not Disturb by maxing STREAM_RING/STREAM_NOTIFICATION/STREAM_ALARM, requesting audio focus, and posting bypass-enabled channels
  - Share last-known and live location updates when granted
  - Initiate optional follow-up phone call prompts
- Multi-contact management with separate escalation profiles per tier (Emergency vs. Check-in)
- Silent SOS mode that suppresses local UI feedback while still signaling contacts

## Do Not Disturb Override
PulseLink guarantees that critical alerts are audible even when the device is in Do Not Disturb (DND) mode.

1. **Audio gain staging** – `AudioOverrideManager` captures the existing STREAM_RING, STREAM_NOTIFICATION, and STREAM_ALARM values, forces them to their maxima, and normalizes the ringer mode before playback. A short propagation delay (≈75 ms) ensures the new levels apply before the siren starts.
2. **Audio focus** – The app requests transient audio focus (`AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT` for emergencies, `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK` for check-ins, and `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE` for incoming-call sirens) so other media is momentarily ducked or paused.
3. **Notification channels** – Emergency channels are created with `IMPORTANCE_MAX`, `USAGE_ALARM`, and `setBypassDnd(true)`. On Android 15 (API 35) and newer, this channel-level bypass is the only supported way to break through global DND because `NotificationManager.setInterruptionFilter(INTERRUPTION_FILTER_ALL)` now applies only to the app's AutomaticZenRule.
4. **Interruption filter fallback** – On Android 14 and below, PulseLink still attempts to flip the global interruption filter back to `ALL` when it has `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY`. Failures are logged and surfaced to the user.
5. **Restoration** – After playback (default 2 minutes, configurable per use case), the manager restores the original volumes, ringer mode, audio focus, and interruption filter to avoid side effects.

### Limitations
- If the user revokes notification-policy access, PulseLink can still raise STREAM_ALARM but cannot change the global DND filter. The UI surfaces this state and points users to Settings.
- Users can manually downgrade channel importance or disable bypass at the system level. PulseLink validates channels on launch and logs when properties drift.
- OEM-specific DND behaviors (e.g., manufacturer skins that remap usage streams) are outside the app's control; troubleshooting guidance instructs users to re-enable bypass per channel.

## Platform Notes
- Android: Compose UI, WorkManager/ForegroundService for long-running tasks, Room for persistence, Hilt for DI. Audio alerts rely on `STREAM_ALARM` for sirens, `AudioAttributes.USAGE_ALARM`, and `MediaPlayer` instances that loop during emergencies.
- iOS: Planned via SwiftUI, CallKit, PushKit (not yet implemented in this rebuild).

## Security & Privacy
- Data minimization: store only hashed phrases + encrypted contact details
- Require biometric or PIN to alter critical settings
- Provide transparent audit log users can clear

## Troubleshooting DND Override
- **No audible alert while in DND** – Confirm PulseLink has Do Not Disturb access, then verify the Emergency Alerts notification channel is set to "Allow" and can bypass DND.
- **Android 15+ device still silent** – Channel bypass is mandatory on API 35+. Re-enable bypass inside Settings → Apps → PulseLink → Notifications.
- **Partial override** – If PulseLink reports a partial override, volumes were raised but global DND could not be disabled (policy missing or Android 15 restriction). Check notification-policy permissions and channel settings.
- **Remote call siren too quiet** – Ensure linked contacts are allowed to override audio (`allowRemoteOverride=true`) and that STREAM_ALARM wasn't manually muted immediately beforehand. The app restores user volume after the override window.

## Multi-Channel Message Delivery
PulseLink employs a robust "Firebase-First, SMS-Fallback" strategy to ensure message delivery under various network conditions.

1. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) & Firestore**:
   - Primary channel for real-time delivery when both devices are online.
   - Messages are written to Firestore `linkChannels/{channelId}/messages`.
   - Firebase Functions trigger FCM notifications to wake up the recipient device.
   - Requires internet connection and valid authentication.

2. **SMS Fallback**:
   - Automatically used if Firebase delivery fails or times out (default timeout: 5s).
   - Also used if the recipient is known to be offline or not linked via Firebase.
   - Ensures delivery even without data connectivity (requires cellular network).
   - Encodes message payload in a compact format prefixed with `PULSELINK`.

3. **Email Fallback (Tertiary)**:
   - Optional fallback if both Firebase and SMS fail.
   - Triggered via Firebase Functions (`sendEmailNotification`).
   - Sends an email with deep links to the recipient.
   - Requires "Email Fallback" to be enabled in Settings.

### Delivery Tracking
The app tracks delivery success rates for each channel per contact. This data is used to optimize channel selection and provide insights into connectivity issues. Users can view delivery statistics in the "Message Delivery Preferences" settings.

### Channel Preferences
Users can configure channel priorities and enable/disable specific channels (e.g., disable Firebase to force SMS-only mode) via Settings.
